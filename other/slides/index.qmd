## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```


## Code chunk

Here is a code chunk:
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: false
ggplot(diamonds,aes(x=carat,y=price,color=cut)) + geom_point()

```


## Table

Here is a table:
```{r}
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```


## Data Table

Here is a table:
```{r}
DT::datatable(mtcars)
```



## Citations and Footnotes

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this. The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Here is a footnote reference,[^aa] and another.[^longnote] You can also reference inline!^[Hello. I am an inline footnote.]

<!-- These footnote definitions can go anywhere make sure there is blank line before/after -->

[^aa]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
  Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

  The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
  line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
  multi-paragraph list items.




Here is a sentence with citation using bibliography. [@cordonnier2009randomized]

The sentence has multiple references. [@adibi2012reduction; @gold2008human; @roach1991ciprofloxacin]
