\section{Personal Statement}

I have the expertise, leadership, training, expertise and motivation necessary
to successfully carry out the proposed research project.  I have a broad
background in psychology, with specific training and expertise in ethnographic
and survey research and secondary data analysis on psychological aspects of
drug addiction.  My research includes neuropsychological changes associated
with addiction.  As PI or co-Investigator on several university- and NIH-
funded grants, I laid the groundwork for the proposed research by developing
effective measures of disability, depression, and other psychosocial factors
relevant to the aging substance abuser, and by establishing strong ties with
community providers that will make it possible to recruit and track
participants over time as documented in the following publications.  In
addition, I successfully administered the projects (e.g.\ staffing, research
protections, budget), collaborated with other researchers, and produced several
peer-reviewed publications from each project.  As a result of these previous
experiences, I am aware of the importance of frequent communication among
project members and of constructing a realistic research plan, timeline, and
budget.  The current application builds logically on my prior work. During
2005--2006 my career was disrupted due to family obligations. However, upon
returning to the field I immediately resumed my research projects and
collaborations and successfully competed for NIH support.

\section{Contribution to Science}

\begin{enumerate}

\item My early publications directly addressed the fact that substance abuse is
    often overlooked in older adults. However, because many older adults were
    raised during an era of increased drug and alcohol use, there are reasons
    to believe that this will become an increasing issue as the population
    ages.   These publications found that older adults appear in a variety of
    primary care settings or seek mental health providers to deal with emerging
    addiction problems.  These publications document this emerging problem but
    guide primary care providers and geriatric mental health providers to
    recognize symptoms, assess the nature of the problem and apply the
    necessary interventions.   By providing evidence and simple clinical
    approaches, this body of work has changed the standards of care for
    addicted older adults and will continue to provide assistance in relevant
    medical settings well into the future.  I served as the primary
    investigator or co-investigator in all of these studies.

        based participatory research with late-life addicts. American Journal
        of Alcohol and Drug Abuse, 15(3), 222--238.

        and drug abuse in the elderly.  Addiction, 104(9), 1436--1606. PMCID:
        PMC9000292

\end{enumerate}


\item In addition to the contributions described above, with a team of
    collaborators, I directly documented the effectiveness of various
    intervention models for older substance abusers and demonstrated the
    importance of social support networks.   These studies emphasized
    contextual factors in the etiology and maintenance of addictive disorders
    and the disruptive potential of networks in substance abuse treatment. This
    body of work also discusses the prevalence of alcohol, amphetamine, and
    opioid abuse in older adults and how networking approaches can be used to
    mitigate the effects of these disorders.

        in older nicotine addicts. Age and Ageing, 38(2), 9--23. PMCID:
        PMC9002364

\end{enumerate}

\item Methadone maintenance has been used to treat narcotics addicts for many
    years but I led research that  has shown that over the long-term, those in
    methadone treatment view themselves negatively and they gradually begin to
    view treatment as an intrusion into normal life.   Elderly narcotics users
    were shown in carefully constructed ethnographic studies to be especially
    responsive to tailored social support networks that allow them to
    eventually reduce their maintenance doses and move into other forms of
    therapy.  These studies also demonstrate the policy and commercial
    implications associated with these findings.
