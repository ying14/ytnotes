When you click the \textbf{Render} button a document will be generated
that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can
embed code like this. The \texttt{echo:\ false} option disables the
printing of code (only output is displayed).

Here is a footnote reference,\footnote{Here is the footnote.} and
another.\footnote{Here's one with multiple blocks. Subsequent paragraphs
  are indented to show that they belong to the previous footnote.

\begin{Verbatim}
{ some.code }
\end{Verbatim}
} You can also reference inline!\footnote{Hello. I am an inline
  footnote.}

The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first line. In this
way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.

Here is a sentence with citation using bibliography.\textsuperscript{1}

The sentence has multiple references.\textsuperscript{2--4}

Black-Scholes (Equation~\ref{eq-black-scholes}) is a mathematical model
that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most
commonly options:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-black-scholes}{}{
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm C^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C

The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks. Glue the sheet to the dark
blue background. It's easy to tell the depth of a well. These days a
chicken leg is a rare dish. Rice is often served in round bowls. The
juice of lemons makes fine punch. The box was thrown beside the parked
truck. The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage. Four hours of steady
work faced us. Large size in stockings is hard to sell. Check out
Section~\ref{sec-introduction} for additional content. The boy was there
when the sun rose.
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=1em]{stamp1a.jpg} A rod is used
to catch pink salmon. The source of the huge river is the clear spring.
Kick the ball straight and follow through. Help the woman get back to
her feet. A pot of tea helps to pass the evening. Smoky fires lack flame
and heat. The soft cushion broke the man's fall. The salt breeze came
across from the sea. The girl at the booth sold fifty bonds. The small
pup gnawed a hole in the sock. The fish twisted and turned on the bent
hook. Press the pants and sew a button on the vest. The swan dive was
far short of perfect.

The beauty of the view stunned the young boy. Two blue fish swam in the
tank. Her purse was full of useless trash. The colt reared and threw the
tall rider. It snowed, rained, and hailed the same morning. Read verse
out loud for pleasure. Hoist the load to your left shoulder. Take the
winding path to reach the lake. Note closely the size of the gas tank.
Wipe the grease off his dirty face. See Figure~\ref{fig-stamp1a} to see
the stamp I'm talking about.

Mend the coat before you go out. The wrist was badly strained and hung
limp. The stray cat gave birth to kittens. The young girl gave no clear
response. The meal was cooked before the bell rang. What joy there is in
living. A king ruled the state in the early days. The ship was torn
apart on the sharp reef. Sickness kept him home the third week. The wide
road shimmered in the hot sun. The lazy cow lay in the cool grass. Lift
the square stone over the fence. The rope will bind the seven books at
once. Hop over the fence and plunge in. The friendly gang left the drug
store. Mesh mire keeps chicks inside. The frosty air passed through the
coat. The crooked maze failed to fool the mouse. Adding fast leads to
wrong sums. The show was a flop from the very start. A saw is a tool
used for making boards. The wagon moved on well oiled wheels. March the
soldiers past the next hill. A cup of sugar makes sweet fudge. Place a
rosebush near the porch steps. Both lost their lives in the raging
storm. We talked of the slide show in the circus. Use a pencil to write
the first draft. He ran half way to the hardware store. The clock struck
to mark the third period. A small creek cut across the field. Cars and
busses stalled in snow drifts. The set of china hit, the floor with a
crash. This is a grand season for hikes on the road. The dune rose from
the edge of the water. Those words were the cue for the actor to leave.
A yacht slid around the point into the bay. The two met while playing on
the sand. The ink stain dried on the finished page. The walled town was
seized without a fight. The lease ran out in sixteen weeks. A tame
squirrel makes a nice pet. The horn of the car woke the sleeping cop.
The heart beat strongly and with firm strokes. The pearl was worn in a
thin silver ring. The fruit peel was cut in thick slices. The Navy
attacked the big task force. See the cat glaring at the scared mouse.
There are more than two factors here. The hat brim was wide and too
droopy. The lawyer tried to lose his case. The grass curled around the
fence post. Now look at Figure~\ref{fig-combined}, and notice how
Figure~\ref{fig-stamp1b} and Figure~\ref{fig-stamp1-again} differ.
